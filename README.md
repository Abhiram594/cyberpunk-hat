Project Overview;
This project is a simple and fun web-based game called Cyberpunk Hat Catcher. The objective is to catch or interact with a cyberpunk-styled hat that moves or responds on the screen. It features a neon black and green cyberpunk aesthetic with cool fonts and animations to give it a stylish futuristic vibe.

Technical Details
Project Type
Web-based interactive game/application

Languages Used
HTML5 — for the structure and layout of the webpage

CSS3 — for styling, animations, and the cyberpunk neon theme

JavaScript (ES6+) — for interactivity, event handling, and animations

Frameworks & Libraries
No major JavaScript frameworks (like React or Angular) were used to keep the project lightweight and simple.

Google Fonts API — used to import the ‘Share Tech Mono’ font, which fits the cyberpunk aesthetic.

How It Works;
When you open the webpage, the hat appears at the center (or a specified starting position).
The hat can be dragged or clicked, depending on your implementation.
It has smooth animations and neon glow effects to match the cyberpunk theme.
The game may have interactive elements like scoring, funny effects, or reactions when the hat is caught or missed (if implemented).
The UI uses cyberpunk-themed fonts and colors (mainly black backgrounds with neon green highlights) to create a cool immersive feel
