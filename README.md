Project Overview;
This project is a simple and fun web-based game called Cyberpunk Hat Catcher. The objective is to catch or interact with a cyberpunk-styled hat that moves or responds on the screen. It features a neon black and green cyberpunk aesthetic with cool fonts and animations to give it a stylish futuristic vibe.

How It Works;
When you open the webpage, the hat appears at the center (or a specified starting position).
The hat can be dragged or clicked, depending on your implementation.
It has smooth animations and neon glow effects to match the cyberpunk theme.
The game may have interactive elements like scoring, funny effects, or reactions when the hat is caught or missed (if implemented).
The UI uses cyberpunk-themed fonts and colors (mainly black backgrounds with neon green highlights) to create a cool immersive feel

What I Learned;
HTML & CSS Styling: How to structure a webpage and style it with CSS for a cyberpunk neon look, including using gradients, shadows, and custom fonts from Google Fonts.
JavaScript DOM Manipulation: How to make an element draggable, move it programmatically,
Animations & Effects: Applying neon glow effects and smooth transitions to UI elements to enhance visual appeal.
